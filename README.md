# Rock-Paper-Scissors
It's a common hand game played between two or more peoples, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes (rock,paper and scissors) with an outstretched hand.

# Rules of Game:

3. Scissors beat Paper (scissors cuts paper)
4. If player beated get score, and if lose no score
5. If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied (No Score)

Simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game on Python code shows how to play the game by a user and computer.
The code is completly made on Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda) platform.

# Computer understands the game like: 

if (player == rock) and (computer == paper); computer wins

if (player == paper) and (computer == paper); tie

if (player == scissors) and (computer == paper); player wins

if (player == rock) and (computer == rock); tie

if (player == paper) and (computer == rock); player wins

if (player == scissors) and (computer == rock); computer wins

if (player == rock) and (computer == scissors); player wins

if (player == paper) and (computer == scissors); computer wins

if (player == scissors) and (computer == scissors); tie
